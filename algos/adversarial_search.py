    A modular implementation of MiniMax algorithm for adversarial games against an AI.

        Parameters:
        ------------
        - player_turn_fn (callable): A function that takes in a state and 
        returns who's player turn is next (+1 for the MAX player, -1 for the MIN player).
        - list_actions_fn (callable): Function that takes in a state and 
        returns a set of all the possible next actions. If action type is custom
        class, make sure it has a  __repr__ method for proper player input eval.
        - take_action (callable): Function that takes in a state, an 
        action and returns the result state.
        - terminal_fn (callable): Function that takes in a state and verifies
        if it is a terminal state, returning a boolean.
        - utility_fn (callable): A function that takes in an end state
        and returns its utility numerical value (+1, 0, -1). The MAX player aims to maximize
        the utility, while the MIN player has the opposite goal.   
        - max_depth (int): Parameter used to limit recursion depth. Default is None (no limit).
        - heuristic_fn (callable): A function that takes in as input a non-terminal state and
        calculates the most likely winner. Returns a real-valued score, where higher score
        means MAX player is more likely to win the game.
        Used when depth limit is on.
        - empty_state: Environment's state in the beginning.
        - pretty_print_fn (callable): Optional function for printing state 
        during the game. Default is normal print. 
        - plays_as: 1 for MAX player, -1 for MIN.
